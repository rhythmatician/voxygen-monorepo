"""Small helpers for emitting progress notifications to stdout.

These functions are intentionally lightweight so that non-GUI users are not
forced to depend on ``tqdm`` or any extra libraries.  The GUI listens for
percentage values anywhere in the child process output and converts them to
circular progress indicators.

Usage examples::

    # simple in-place call inside a loop
    for i, x in enumerate(things):
        ...
        progress.report(i, len(things))

    # or wrap an iterable to get implicit reporting
    for i, item in progress.wrap(enumerable, desc="Doing thing"):
        ...

The printed lines look like ``"[PROGRESS] 42%"`` which is recognised by
``RunWorker``'s regex and results in a progress signal to the GUI.
